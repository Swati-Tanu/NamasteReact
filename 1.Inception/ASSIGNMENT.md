# ⚛️ React - A JavaScript Library

> It was developed by **Jordan Walke**, a software engineer at **Facebook**.

### 💡 React Injection

React can be injected into a portion of our app too — the app doesn't have to be completely built by React.
For example, only the header can be built using React.

### 🌐 CDN Links

In CDN link,

* The first one (**react.development**) consists of core React code.
* The second one (**react-dom.development**) consists of code to modify the DOM.

We have two separate files because we need something so that React is rendered on:
🖥️ browsers (**React DOM**)
📱 mobile phones (**React Native**)
🎮 and even 3D environments, etc.

> The order of script files matters, whether CDN links or just importing the index.js link.

### 🧠 JSX

Since writing nesting code using React core can be a tedious work, that is why we use **JSX**.

## ❓ Q1: What is Emmet?

**A:** `Emmet` is the essential toolkit for web-developers.
It allows you to type shortcuts that are then expanded into full pieces of code for writing HTML and CSS,
based on an abbreviation structure most developers already use — which expands into full-fledged HTML markup and CSS rules.

## ⚙️ Q: Difference between a Library and Framework?

**A:**
A `library` is a collection of packages that perform specific operations,
whereas a `framework` contains the basic flow and architecture of an application.

The major difference between them is **complexity**.
Libraries contain a number of methods that a developer can just call whenever they write code.

The `framework` provides the flow of a software application and tells the developer what it needs and calls the code provided by the developer as required.
If a `library` is used, the application calls the code from the library.

> 🧩 `React.js` is a **library**, and `Angular` is a **framework**.

## 🌎 Q: What is CDN? Why do we use it?

**A:**
A `content delivery network (CDN)` refers to a geographically distributed group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.

The main use of a CDN is to deliver content through a network of servers in a secure and efficient way.

## ⚛️ Q: Why is React known as React?

**A:**
`React` is named React because of its ability to **react to changes in data**.

React is called React because it was designed to be a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

The name `React` was chosen because the library was designed to allow developers to "react" to changes in state and data within an application,
and to update the user interface in a declarative and efficient manner.

`React` is a `JavaScript-based UI development library`.
`Facebook` and an `open-source developer community` run it.

## 🔐 Q: What is crossorigin in script tag?

**A:**
The `crossorigin` attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP **CORS Request**.

The purpose of crossorigin attribute is to share the resources from one domain to another domain.
Basically, it is used to handle the CORS request that checks whether it is safe to allow sharing resources from other domains.

### 🧩 *Syntax*

```html
<script crossorigin="anonymous|use-credentials">
```

## 🧱 Q: What is difference between React and ReactDOM?

**A:**
`React` is a JavaScript library for building User Interfaces, whereas `ReactDOM` is also a JavaScript library that allows **React to interact with the DOM**.

The **react** package contains:

* `React.createElement()`
* `React.Component`
* `React.Children`
* and other helpers related to elements and component classes.

You can think of these as the isomorphic or universal helpers that you need to build components.

The **react-dom** package contains:

* `ReactDOM.render()`, and
* in `react-dom/server`, we have server-side rendering support with:

  * `ReactDOMServer.renderToString()`
  * `ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup()`.

## 🧾 Q: What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?

**A:**
`Development` is the stage of an application before it's made public,
while `production` is the term used for the same application when it's made `public`.

> ⚙️ `Development build` is several times (maybe 3–5x) **slower** than the `production build`.

---

## ⚡ Q: What is async and defer?

**A:**

### ⚙️ Async

The `async` attribute is a **boolean attribute**.
The script is downloaded in **parallel (in the background)** to parsing the page,
and **executed as soon** as it is available.
(It does not block HTML DOM construction during downloading process and doesn’t wait for anything.)

#### 🧩 *Syntax*

```html
<script src="demo_async.js" async></script>
```

---

### 🕒 Defer

The `defer` attribute is a **boolean attribute**.
The script is downloaded in **parallel (in the background)** to parsing the page,
and **executed after** the page has finished parsing (when browser finished DOM construction).

The `defer` attribute tells the browser **not to wait for the script**.
Instead, the browser will continue to process the HTML and build the DOM.

#### 🧩 *Syntax*

```html
<script src="demo_defer.js" defer></script>
```

---

### 🧠 Modules Tip

Unless you're supporting ancient legacy systems, always add `type="module"` to all your script tags:

```html
<script type="module" src="main.js"></script>
```

> and place the tag inside `<head>`

```html
<script defer nomodule></script>
```

> can be used as a legacy fallback.

---

### 🔍 Additional Notes

* It allows you to import **modules**, which makes it easier to organize your code.
* Enables **strict mode** by default — this makes your code run faster and reports more runtime errors instead of silently ignoring them.
* Executes your code **only after the DOM has initialized**, making DOM manipulation easier.
  Thanks to this, you won't need to listen to `load` / `readystatechange` / `DOMContentLoaded` events.
* Prevents top-level variables from implicitly polluting the global namespace.
* Allows you to use **top-level await** in supported engines.
* Loads and parses your code **asynchronously**, improving load performance.
