Tailwind

when tailwind css intellisense doesnt give suggestion press ctrl+space bar

Tailwind is very light weight, as it only load/include the classes that is used in the component. also if class m-4 is used 100 times across the app, tailwind will only include it one time. So it keeps the bundle size small.
